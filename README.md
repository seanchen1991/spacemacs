# Spacemacs Configuration

My Spacemacs configuration file, and any other Spacemacs-related things that
benefit from being added to version control.

Spacemacs expects the `.spacemacs` config file to be located in your home
directory. You can create a symlink pointing to the actual config file with
`ln -s path/to/.spacemacs .spacemacs` in your home directory.
